## SSU rRNA gene database

The [PR<sup>2</sup> database](https://pr2-database.org/) was initiated
in 2010 in the frame of the BioMarks project from work that had
developed in the previous ten years in the Plankton Group of the Station
Biologique of Roscoff. Its aim is to provide a reference database of
carefully annotated 18S rRNA sequences using eight unique taxonomic
fields (from domain to species). At present it contains about 240,000
sequences. A number of metadata fields are available for many sequences,
including geo-localisation, whether it originates from a culture or a
natural sample, host type etc… The annotation of PR2 is performed by
experts from each taxonomic groups. One very important project in this
respect is [EukRef](https://pr2-database.org/eukref/about/) which has
recently decided to merge its effort with PR<sup>2</sup>. EukRef has
built bioinformatics pipelines that have been used during three
workshops dedicated to specific taxonomic groups.

The web interface now includes links to the sequences of the Ribosomal
Operon Database (ROD) published in Krabberød, A.K., Stokke, E., Thoen,
E., Skrede, I. & Kauserud, H. 2025. [The Ribosomal Operon Database: A
